Chapter 5: Here we find out a little bit of why our hero is the chosen one. When given the chance to join the dark lord and save everyone and all that he cares about, he selflessly choses to sacrifice all that he loves in order to fulfill his duty. And we find out that while doing so he discovers his powers, he finds a way to get in touch with his friends and alert them of the incoming danger, and in doing so is able to alert the mentor who comes and saves him for the time being.
